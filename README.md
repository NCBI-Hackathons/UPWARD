# Community Phen Gen

We are creating a program that will pull out all pathogenic or likely pathogenic SNPs that are currently included on the chips that are used for some common direct to consumer genetic/ancestry tests. 

This program can help us identify whether people who run their raw data through a database such as Promethease may find that they have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic SNP in any of the Porphyria genes. Collecting the experiences of people who are identified from the general population in this fashion would be valuable because we do not currently know how they are following up with this information. Although most of these individuals will never develop symptoms (due to the low penetrance of these genes), it may prove useful to see if these individuals would enroll in future studies trying to compare those with latent and active porphyria in order to identify modifying genes and environmental factors that contribute to the phenotype.

# Background:
Porphyria is a group of eight inherited genetic disorders that arise when the body is unable to synthesize heme used to transport oxygen throughout the body. This negatively affects the skin and/or nervous system causing symptoms including extreme abdominal and chest pain, skin blistering, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and possibly leading to paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures.

Porphyria is divided into two main types, acute and cutaneous, depending on the most commonly experienced symptoms. Acute Porphyrias typically present with attacks of symptoms, like intense abdominal pain or skin blistering, which become more severe over several days. Cutaneous Porphyrias may result in skin blistering, redness, scarring, and pain when exposed to the sun.

Likely affecting 1 to 100 people in every 50,000, Porphyria is a rare disease which on average takes 10-15 years to diagnose following the onset of symptoms. Once Porphyria is recognized diagnostic testing can be performed via blood, urine, stool and genetic testing.

# Methods:
To build a database of pathogenic or likely pathogenic SNPs we have sourced Ancestry and 23andMe data (Illumina OmniExpress & Illumina GSA microarray chips) and compared to ClinVar entries with an output of the rs ID, the SNP location, and the level of pathogenicity.
